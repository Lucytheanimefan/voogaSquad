So I was challenged to explore new forms, energy flow and interactions between components as they evolved. A new world of creativity opened up for me. I was pleasantly surprised when the completed work took brilliant new forms that I had never imagined.

Project Scientist is a summer day camp for girls where interns like myself lead young girls through hands on experiments and activities in order to increase their exposure to and interest in STEM. This past year, I was part of the camp_Ñés effort to incorporate computer science components and introduce basic coding skills to the girls. Through this work experience, I have learned the behind-the-scenes running and execution of a non-profit and been a part of a group of organized, creative, and curious. These skills can be easily transferred to my computer science endeavors and an internship with a tech company. When I came to Duke, I was thrilled that I could continue my passion for working with girls in STEM through a club called FEMMES (Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science). FEMMES is an after-school program in the Durham schools that pique girls_Ñé interest in STEM through hands on activities and experiments. I was selected as the _ÑÒAfter-School Program Director_Ñ this past year, in charge of overseeing over a hundred volunteers as well as designing and implementing STEM experiments for the volunteers to complete with the students. This experience has prepared me to work efficiently, intentionally, and passionately. I am accustomed to carrying great amounts of responsibility, to working and learning with others, and to sticking to deadlines and goals. Inside the classroom, I dedicate myself to academic success. My first two semesters at Duke, I made the Dean_Ñés List (top third of the class) and received A_Ñés in both CS101, Introductory to Computer Science, and CS201, Data Structures and Algorithms. In addition, I work as a Peer Tutor for Duke students in these introductory courses, and this has helped solidify my knowledge of the the core topics in these courses and my understanding of object oriented programming. ","I am proficient in Java, C, and Python and understand algorithmic complexity. I have built a Huffman encoding data compression algorithm, Markov chain generator, and autocomplete algorithm using tries. In my computer architecture class, I implemented a single-cycle MIPS-like processor in software and simple finite state machines.  ","As I get further along in the computer science major at Duke, I notice the number of women in my classes dwindle. Some of my female friends have quit the computer science major all ready, and I_Ñéve had other friends tell me they don_Ñét want to try it because it_Ñés _ÑÒtoo hard and stressful._Ñ I am left wondering what could be changed so that one day I might look around my upper level computer science courses to see an even split of men and women - imagine what progress the world of computing would experience through this change.Through my work with Project Scientist and leadership position in FEMMES at Duke, I appreciate the power of mentorships. I have come to understand how important and rewarding it is to make an impact in girls_Ñé lives. An anecdote from my experience at Project Scientist this past summer highlights this point for me. At the beginning and end of each camp week, counselors hand out the ""DAST"" or ""Draw a Scientist Test"". The task for the girls is simple: draw whatever comes to mind when they picture a scientist. Most girls at the beginning of the week drew male scientists with wicked white curly hair and test tubes. By the end of the week, I found girls drawing themselves instead. The camp had opened up a new image for them of the excitement and intellectual exploration in STEM. Witnessing and being a part of this evolution makes working with girls in STEM one of the most rewarding experiences in my life thus far. I have seen firsthand the need for role models for girls to look up to in computer science fields, and I would like to find these kinds of role models for myself as well.Every week at Project Scientist, we would take the girls to a STEM company in the Charlotte area so that they could see positive images of the types of companies that they could one day work for and thrive in. These real world experiences have not only been invaluable to the girls but also to me. I_Ñéve discovered that developing relationships with women in STEM careers provides girls of all ages with role models who they can aspire to be and who can answer questions and concerns they might have. What draws me to the Kick Ass Fellows Program is the emphasis on mentorship and networking. I am very open to sharing my experiences and connecting with others in order to learn more about their interests, goals, and careers. I am very aware of the impact these relationships would have on me and how I can use my new knowledge and awareness to impact others. I would be armed with a more rounded perspective of what to expect from working at a technology company, which I would incorporate as I continue to share my passion for STEM and computer science with others.  What also draws me to the Kick Ass Fellows Program is the environments in which I would gain the real world experience. I would be working with companies who support women in computing. I would be very engaged in the company tours, guest experts, and general workplace discussion on female-centric topics because of my sincere interest in gaining understanding about computer science and passion for connecting with others_Ñé experiences. With all of these perks on top of an internship where I can put my knowledge from the classroom to the test, the Kick Ass Fellows Program would be an opportunity of a lifetime that I believe would influence path in computer science forever. ","I am interested in a back end software development position that will allow me to apply my object oriented background as well as my data and algorithms skills that I have learned in the classroom. I am willing to be placed with either a big or small company in any city.  ","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","I plan on completing a Certificate in Documentary Studies at Duke. Ever since I was young, I have loved filming and taking photographs of anything I encounter. I enjoy editing videos made up of clips of different adventures I go on with my friends or making a highlight reel of my favorite NFL team, the Carolina Panthers. I even incorporated this passion into my internship with Project Scientist, filming the girls as they had fun with the experiments and making a final video for their parents to watch at the end of each week. Taking these courses demonstrates my appreciation for the different technical skills which is a part of documentary studies as well as my passion for sharing my experiences with others. I have sold over 1000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies!

Although I am not a master in the language I have a very solid grasp and want to learn more.I am currently learning Java in Computer Science 201 and although I am not as proficient in it as I am in Python, I do have a good basic understanding.","About a month ago I attended a screening of a documentary at Duke called Code: Debugging the Gender Gap. Before this I had a vague sense of gender inequality within the tech industry, but this film really put it into focus for me. Currently, technology is a man_Ñés world, and when women see it as a man_Ñés world it discourages them from trying to break into it. Nobody likes to spend their life working alongside people they can_Ñét identify with. I think Kick Ass Coders is doing incredible work in changing this by targeting young women who will then influence the generations after them.Technology is meant to reach large groups of people, and if the people creating it aren_Ñét diverse how can we expect it to do that? I want to be a part of the next generation of programmers who will draw on a plethora of backgrounds so that we can push boundaries and create things that no fairly uniform group could. I also truly believe in the power of mentorship as a leading force in people_Ñés lives, especially as a woman. When I was in high school I had some incredible older women guide me, and I truly don_Ñét think I would be the person I am today without them. Because of the lack of women within the tech industry I have found it hard to find female mentors, but with Kick Ass Coders I know I could, and I truly believe that will help my career path immensely.","I find the intersection between the arts and technology fascinating, so I would love to combine those two interests wherever I work. I think it is very easy for people to polarize art and technology and see them as being fields for two very different types of people. I strongly disagree, since creativity is essential in solving any computer science program, and logic is often used in art. As far as specific companies, my dream job is at HBO working in UI/UX or post-production, but I would also love to work at Industrial Light and Magic, Squarespace, or Spotify.

Importantly, I have the ability to abstract, think on different levels, and see how there are many possible solutions to a single problem. On one hand I am good at following directions, but on the other hand, I can channel my creative side in thinking of innovative ways to solve a problem. Being a Computer Science 101 TA, I also have the ability to verbally communicate the objectives of a code in a clear and concise manner. Working as an assistant at an interior design firm _ÑÐ a field I knew nothing about before starting my job _ÑÐ provided me with the confidence to delve into things that I may not initially be comfortable or familiar with. Being on the Standard Web Team, I have not only become familiar with CSS and HTML, but I have also gotten exposure to front-end web development. On the web team, we have the freedom to take initiative on projects we think would benefit the web publication. This semester, I am on a project team that tackling the issue of inflexibility with posts that affect the overall aesthetic of the site. From these experiences, I have learned to be adaptable and as an open to learning new and challenging ways to solve problems _ÑÐ all skills I hope would be relevant to an internship with a tech company. Moreover, as mentioned in my cover letter, I coded an Autocomplete algorithm that suggested possible completions for text search entries through the use of methods and interfaces by considering the relevance and likelihood of certain search queries. Another project that I really liked and think is relevant is Huffman in which we created methods to both compress and decompress files. ","I have coded extensively in Java and Python and have a general knowledge of CSS and HTML. I also have good communication skills and can document, explain, and communicate details of a problem and my solution to it. I also have the ability to critically think and reason through problems. From my classes, I have learned to recognize patterns and abstract when dealing with complex problems. Moreover, in my discrete math class, I have learned mathematic and computation theories such as: set theory, graph theory, number theory, probability, and general data analysis, among others.","I see Kick Ass Coders as an opportunity to apply my knowledge of programming and my problems solving skills and gains real hands-on experience in the field of technology. Importantly, I am very much driven and motivated by those around me; I know that surrounding myself with women who are hard-working, problem-solvers, and innovative will propel me to think on different levels. As I have learned from doing group work in class, many times I see one way to solve a problem, while my group-mates see a completely different way to solve a problem. At times, my approach is not the most efficient and so having the opportunity to get insight on how others solve problems is important. It forces me to think on a level that I might not have come to had I just worked on the problem myself. Moreover, I am really excited by the prospect of having not only a mentor who I can serve as a point of contact and an immediate resource, but also by having a network of other students participating in the program who I can also reach out to.","I would really love to gain experience to a Product Management role. I want to learn about the process of designing, building and rolling out products. I believe that I would really enjoy both generating new ideas and filling product gaps that improve customer experiences in addition to learning about the process of actually programming products that consumers would use. I am also really interested in software development _ÑÐ the brains behind the design, installation, and testing of software systems. In class, we are always presented with problems where we are asked to improve cost or time efficiency _ÑÐ and so I feel that this is something I would really like to get gain exposure to. However, I am willing to try other positions as well. I would really love to work for a big company such as Apple. I have heard many wonderful things about the company culture. Importantly, I have heard that individuals who in high positions at Apple make themselves accessible to individuals who are not _ÑÐ such as interns. Moreover, I see many benefits of working at a big company. For example, I think I could get a lot out of working at a big company because there is a lot of diversity out of nature of having a greater number of employees. Again, I grow and learn a lot from the people around me so diversity is something I take into high consideration. Moreover, I would like to work at a big company because I would like the flexibility to move from technical roles to project management roles (more jobs exists within a larger firm). But I am very open to working at other sized companies. I mainly just want to be able to be in an environment where I feel that I can experience as much as possible about the industry and have a solid group of people I can reach out to if needed.","Washington DC, Silicon Valley","I have had two art pieces featured in the greenwich bruce museum.

These entertaining problems ranged from finding a path through a predetermined, block game board to optimizing the time efficiency for typists. We were only given a statement of the problem and could take it in any way we wished. I love this sort of challenge. In my mind, computer science is the very essence of problem solving. I enjoyed puzzling over how to put a real life problem into a computer science solution. My favorite puzzle was the question of how to count all the occurrences of a predetermined word in Boggle scoreboard. I spent hours on this problem, debating with others about the best, most elegant algorithm to use. Through this class, I honed my problem solving skills in the context of developing clear, efficient code that accomplished the goal. The skills I developed and refined in this class will help me to successfully tackle the company_Ñés real world problems as an intern.My most rewarding project was building a processor. It amazes me that with only a fabric of Boolean logic a processor can decode instructions, and transform information into solutions. From this extensive project, I have foundational knowledge from which to build upon. My knowledge of the interactions between the hardware and software will help me build better, more efficient programs to optimize memory usage and other hardware components. The processor project also taught me to approach programming with a new mindset. I quickly learned that there is no _ÑÒsorta_Ñ to programming; you must understand the function of every single line. I learned how to effectively debug and logically think through every step to deduce where the errors are. With this experience, I will be faster at finding errors.","I have taken 3 semesters of computer science classes at Duke and at my high school. I have worked with different data structures, such as linked lists, hashmaps, trees and many more. I have also analyzed and implemented different well-known algorithms, especially focused on sorting. I have completed many different programs to solve varying problems, such as finding all the possible ways to win in checkers. I understand both the hardware side as well as the software and their interactions. I built a processor and have created sophisticated programs in MIPS assembly language, such as creating an organized structure of linked lists and sorting them. I have coded extensively in Java, C and MIPS and could quickly pick up other languages as needed.","Last summer, I attended the information session in Silicon Valley with the pilot group of interns. At this information session, I was inspired by Melanie Krassel_Ñés presentation. She discussed how she analyzed the company_Ñés email data to find the best times to send out promotional emails and optimize the clients_Ñé interaction with the email. Her work and code was not discarded as just an intern_Ñés work but rather, the company implemented her algorithm and sent out their emails accordingly. The resulting increase in sales was almost immediate. Her experience excites me; I would find it thrilling to tackle a company_Ñés real world problem. I enjoy analyzing data and really thinking through the best, most efficient algorithm to use. While I do enjoy the problems in class, I would find it satisfying to complete a project that would make an impact and a difference as Melanie_Ñés project did. It is clear to me that this program gives incredible opportunities to women to have impactful, meaningful internships. Having an internship like Melanie_Ñés internship would also give me an invaluable chance to grow and hone my problem solving and programming skills. Through the internship, I would be working with more experienced programmers. I would learn skills and see how my fellow coworkers maximize their efficiency and take on different problems and issues. This is where you can learn the most outside of the classroom in real time.  ","I am open to the type of position and the company where I intern.  My hope is that I will be involved in real work, where I can make a meaningful contribution to the company and an opportunity to engage with experienced development professionals.","Washington DC, Silicon Valley","1. I have been acting since I was five years old. While other people feel fear in front of an audience, I feel a jolt of electricity that invigorates me. My comfort in public speaking gives me my most valued gift: a voice. My voice gives me the power and confidence to express myself. Particularly as a female computer science major, I have the courage to share my ideas, asks questions and assert myself in male-dominated classes when I notice some of my fellow, capable female classmates shying away. I speak up to protect others, challenge norms and incorporate females into the conversation. Many times in groups, people will not share opinions that disagree with the leaders or the accepted status quo. But I will. Once one person is brave enough to disagree, I have found that others will pitch in and contribute new ideas, leading to more innovative, creative solutions.  2. Last semester in the middle of winter, I spent three full days standing in a line (with the occasional reprieve for class from my line partner). We slept in the freezing cold for three nights and withstood the driving rain for the legendary basketball game: Duke vs. North Carolina. Insane right? When I reflect back to waiting in line, it seems absolutely crazy. However once I commit to something, I am all in, and I keep going even after the 6th hour of being rained on with no protection. I believe that the truly valuable things in life require work and dedication. The game was one of those valuable experiences. It was an incredible life experience to be surrounded by fellow Cameron Crazies, screaming and very passionately rooting on our team. Surprisingly, I plan to do it all over again this year. 3. At first I thought that badminton was not a real sport, I went to the initial practices to condition with the team and get in better shape. Within days, I fell in love with the sport_Ñés quick pace, mental challenge of placing the birdie and predicting the opponent_Ñés next move. I was amongst experienced and skilled players. I also felt marginalized by stereotypes being a white female player in the midst of a majority of Asians and males. Often opponents would make offensive comments and assume that I was not a skilled player. Both my love of the sport and my desire to prove the critics wrong motivated me to dig deep and learn the skills. I committed: I stayed after during practices to get private coaching with my coach, I put up a net at my house and I conditioned intensely before the season started. All the hard work paid off. I got to represent my high school in the Northern California championships, the equivalent of state championships for smaller states.","Dr. Alvin LebeckPhone Number:  919-660-6551Email address: alvy@cs.duke.eduRelationship: my Computer Architecture professor"

Then I took my first programming class, and I was hooked. I love programming. The tears, the frustration, the absolute joy when your code finally works. At the same time, I hardly know anything about programming, and almost nothing about the tech industry. When the previous question asked, ""What areas of technology are you interested in?"" I didn't (and still don't) know what those areas exactly refer to, so I selected all of them. As a first-year, I have so much to learn, and I'm willing to give it my all.I went to an all-girls school, so I was never truly a witness to the gender gap in computer science, but even within that environment there was the overhanging idea that women didn't ""belong."" An idea that I detest. I wasn't aware of just how dramatic the tech gender gap was until college, and a major eye-opener for me was the screening of ""Code: Debugging the Gender Gap."" Watching that film brought on a whirlwind of emotions. Fear, sadness, frustration, encouragement. I'll admit, the dismal statistics and personal narratives even made me question my desire to enter the tech industry. But I know that computer science is something that I love, and, despite the doubts and difficulties, want to pursue. In fact, the documentary gave me the last bit of incentive that I needed to apply for a position on HeForShe@Duke's executive board. I'm now Director of Digital Media for HeForShe@Duke, a club who's focus is encouraging social change for the achievement of gender equality. Working with the other executive members (and even just discussing gender equality issues with them) has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and it's encouraged and given me confidence to be confident in my abilities.

However, after deciding to attend, I learned from older friends at Princeton that the computer science curriculum here is very beginners-friendly, and there are many support systems for female students like myself considering it, such as Society for Women Engineers, Princeton Women in CS, and, I have just learned more recently, Kick Ass Coders! Therefore, right at the beginning of freshman year, I have decided to sign up for the introduction to CS class (COS126), to immediately test out the waters.

Since then, unable to take a formal computer science course through my high school, I have searched for alternate ways to expose myself to this fascinating subject. I began teaching myself coding basics through websites such as Codecademy. During junior year of high school, I registered for and completed a semester of an AP Computer Science MOOC in an effort to learn more. That year, I applied for a month-long summer math and science camp called COSMOS at the University of California, San Diego where I was introduced to mobile phone application development, robot-building and programming, and open-source hardware and software. These experiences have consolidated my interest in computer science and influenced my decision to pursue a degree in it.Recently, during an Intro to Computer Science lecture, the professor was explaining a complicated program and made an intriguing comment that caused me to pause: He confidently stated, _ÑÒYou, too, now know enough computer science to design and write your own program like this._Ñ My first reaction was doubt. Do I really know enough to create something like that? I questioned myself. But that initial reaction was quickly overshadowed by my excitement over the thought that I could design and produce my own projects. It made me eager to apply the knowledge that I had learned in the classroom to personal projects beyond what I had to complete for a course assignment. That is why I am interested in Kick Ass Coders so that I can be placed in an environment where I am challenged to produce incredible and innovative technology rather than continue to consume it.Moreover, I am interested in the mentorship program and networking opportunities that Kick Ass Coders offers. I like that students will be closely working with mentors to help guide them and prevent them from getting left behind. It is imperative to keep women engaged in computer science because it can be a daunting field to navigate as it is typically associated and filled with men.

The Boarders_Ñé Report(BR) was an online news aggregator addressing boarding school student life, an angle unapproached by other free online services. Knowing little about website development, I spent my summer teaching myself PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After co-launching the site and reaching viewers in over 120 countries, I continued coding for our online platform throughout high school. I improved my technical skills to add new features to the site, like a commenting section and social media feed. I reached the highest level of computer science courses offered at Exeter. I took Dynamic Web Development where we built websites using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. I took Algorithms and Data Structures where I completed projects regarding Huffman data compression, search trees, mergesort, stacks and queues in Java. I took Cryptography where I used Processing for a steganography project encoding a message into an image, I also created the Enigma cipher machine in Java.After learning how to develop Android apps in our Networks and Mobile Architecture class, three classmates and I created an app called Seals and Balls. In this game, seals randomly move across the bottom of the screen as a beach ball falls from the sky. Earning as many points as possible, the player uses the space bar to propel a falling beach ball upward, aiming to land it on a seal_Ñés head. If the ball hits the ground, the game is over and the score is calculated. For this project I used Java, XML and the Android SDK. The app opens with the main activity which has a button coded with XML that leads to the game board activity, including the seals, ball and score.  In addition to Java and XML files for both, I created files for ball movement using Android graphics, generation of seals, and SQLiteDatabase to keep track of the score. We created XML files for strings, styles and dimensions. We used Github, making most commits on a single member_Ñés account. While each member contributed to most files, I lead designing the game as well as coding the activities and movement for seals and the ball.I spent a few summers working for a tech startup in New York_Ñés Silicon Alley that creates a digital library for students in developing countries lacking educational resources. I spent my time writing code for a beta webpage using HTML and CSS and helped with the code for the app using Apache Cordova. This was particularly meaningful to as the daughter of a Haitian immigrant. During my second summer I continued writing code for the website and worked with Raspberry Pis in the Haiti office. Currently, I work as a research assistant for Princeton University_Ñés Map and Geospatial Center encoding metadata records in XML and using ArcGis software as well as publishing data on Princeton_Ñés mapping database. I am on web development team for Princeton_Ñés Innovation club. Lastly, I teamed up with three other Princeton students for the fall hackathon HackPrinceton. For our project, we created an android app for social life at Princeton. Throughout the week and on weekends, Princeton students attend parties at various eating clubs on campus. A common issue is that students have difficulty finding which eating clubs are open throughout  the week, and which of their friends are going. This app allows you to select an eating club and see who is currently there, as well as make your location visible to your friends. For this app we used Android studio and used a Firebase database for updating the list of people at each eating club. We received notable mention from the Undergraduate Student Government Committee members during the hackathon.","I am interested in Kick Ass Coders because I am passionate about programming, and am eager to delve into the technical world outside of academia at a company.

I was first exposed to computer science when I participated in a robotics summer program in middle-school. Since then I have been constantly engaged in computer science and technology. I began programming Freshman year in high school and loved the systematic problem solving that is the focus of computer science. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to take computer science courses every year in high school and over the course of those four years and in continuing my studies at UPenn, have been involved in many different projects. The project that I was first very proud of came at the end of my first year studying computer science, was a text-based game written in Java where I learned the importance of planning, as the game took place in many _ÑÒrooms_Ñ and keeping track of location and attributes of the player became difficult to do without a written plan and diagram of the game. In my Sophomore Design and Data Structures course, a classmate and I programmed an iOS game inspired by a popular app at the time, FlappyBird, adding features that personalized the game and presented it at the Harvard-Westlake STEAM Open House. To program the app, I learned Objective C as well as valuable lessons in working closely with a partner to combine our creative vision into one functional program. In my Programming Languages and Techniques course at UPenn, I have coded many projects including a paint program in OCaml and a photo editing program in Java. Through these programs, ideas about encapsulation and clarity have been emphasized as I have had to present my programs and explain its functionality and my design decisions. Outside of class, as a Freshman in high-school, I started a program introducing children to programming, design and robotics, using 3-D printing, laser cutting and Hummingbird Arduinos in partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Santa Monica and Venice. The course curriculum has evolved since the program started in 2012 and each year my skills in planning, communication and leadership, and my love for technology have been strengthened. I also mentored a Girl Scout FIRST Lego Robotics team to win Best Designed Robot and further exercised my skills in explaining projects, design and leadership. Continuing to take leadership roles in robotics, I was the co-leader of the design team for my high-school robotics team and helped design the robot using CAD software and managed the budget. With a background in computer science and technology, as well as developed leadership and communication skills, I am confident in my abilities to contribute and learn as a KAC fellow.","Working knowledge: Java, OCamlBasic knowledge: Swift, Objective C, Arduino","I_Ñém interested in Kick Ass Coders (KAC) to gain industry experience in computer science and tech as well as connect with other female computer scientists. I want to contribute to a leading tech company and rewardingly apply my skills as a computer scientist, team member and analytic thinker. KAC_Ñés program not only allows for industry experience but an opportunity to connect with other women in computer science. With KAC_Ñés unique mentorship program, I would have the opportunity to learn from more experienced female computer scientists and I would build confidence in my decision to major in Computer Science. Also, with KAC_Ñés unique opportunity to live with other motivated female computer scientists, I would forge strong friendships with students from around the US, creating a nationwide network. As a part of this network, I would look forward to connecting women from my KAC network with my existing network to support each other and younger female computer scientists.",I am interested in working in a Software Engineering position but am open to exploring other positions.

I was able to play a variety of roles, from design, software engineering, to product management, and learn to adapt to an agile development process.As the tech lead of the startup, I also gained leadership skills that translate into the ability to work in a team and resolve conflicts, which are important in tech companies since most projects are collaborative. I learned to communicate my expectations clearly through persuading a skilled developer to work with the team instead of sprinting with the project on his own. I also learned to make difficult decisions and face uncomfortable situations as I had to dismiss a member from the startup since they did not improve after several warnings. Through taking the fundamental courses at Princeton, which include learning about data structures, algorithms, programming systems, and computer science theory, and also working on side projects, I gained both theoretical understanding of computer science and practical skills to develop products.","I am most proficient in C, Java, Matlab, R, and Python. I have used C and Java in school projects in implementing several algorithms and complicated projects such as creating a Unix Shell. I have used Matlab and R for data science and neuroscience research projects, from data visualization to training data sets. I have used Python in most of my side projects, particularly in the back-end of web projects.I also have a clear understanding of full-stack web development as last summer, I have had the chance to use Django (Python) as a web framework for the product of the startup. I developed with both front-end technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and with Python for back-end. I also learned to develop tests in Python and deploy the application on Amazon Web Services.","I remember the first time I attended the new officers_Ñé meeting of Open Source at Princeton, keenly aware that I was the only woman on the executive board of seven people. I remember coming to the Computational and Systems Neuroscience conference, expecting a more balanced ratio in the field of neuroscience, but still surprised and intimidated by the predominant group of male presenters and attendees. There were many more instances where I was very aware of being a minority in the room, even though I have entered the field of computer science for only two years. Last year, I was lucky to be a Grace Hopper Scholar to attend the conference of women in computing. It was the first time ever that I was able to feel so comfortable talking about technology and inspired by other talented women. I know that this is the kind of environment I have always yearned for, and Kick Ass Coders is the answer to that.I believe in the power of surrounding oneself with inspiring people, especially in a field where oneself is a minority. At Kick Ass Coders, I can find women who are both supportive and ambitious, who will not only provide guidance but also push me beyond my comfort zone. There, I will be surrounded with other creative problem solvers whom I can learn diverse perspectives to improve my creativity and technical skills. There, I will be able to see for myself the vast possibilities of what I can do with computer science through learning from mentors and peers. To me, mentorship and friendship are important in enriching one_Ñés own knowledge, and I know that the experience Kick Ass Coders provides extends those relationships beyond the summer we spend together. The community and mentorship aspects of Kick Ass Coders immensely appeals to me, and I hope to not only enjoy the benefits of surrounding myself with talented women but also pay it forward by helping other fellows along the way.","I am interested in companies that are socially conscious and encourage employees/interns to be entrepreneurial (For example, Facebook is socially conscious through developing products such as disaster check-in, voting reminders, etc. and also encourage entrepreneurship by assigning interns standalone projects during the summer). ",Silicon Valley,"I moved from Vietnam to America five years ago, and just became a US citizen last week. Adjusting to another whole different culture in the middle of high school was difficult, but it prepared me well for the diversity I encountered in college and helped me appreciate my privilege for being able to have the education I would never have had back home.Knitting is one of my hobby! I came across knitting by joining the Helping Hands club, where students create and sell handmade items to fight against human trafficking. Being someone who never picked up a needle, I learned as much as possible from the current members and fell in love with knitting in the process. I became the most prolific knitter, bringing the club more than fifty hats and becoming the president of the club for two years. In college, I still return to knitting to calm myself when stressed and have helped my friends pick up the hobby. I started my startup, HackerPack, from a hackathon project. Originally, HackerPack was born to as a website with aggregated resources to help first-time hackers at hackathons. However, I got very passionate about it in the process and decided to apply to eLab accelerator two days before the deadline. The application process was a hackathon itself _ÑÐ my founder and I stayed up two nights to complete the preliminary website and the ten-page application in the middle of midterms week.

Participating in hackathons really made me fall in love with coding _ÑÐ there's nothing quite like conceptualizing and then building something tangible from scratch in just a day or two (often learning new skills, like Android development, along the way)!  Since attending my first hackathon in February (TreeHacks), I've participated in eight more, including CalHacks last weekend, and I'm planning to go to many more over the course of the year.3. I'm passionate about using my coding skills to contribute to social good!  As I discussed earlier, I'm currently working on an Android app (for the nonprofit Safecity) which will provide a platform for people to report incidents of sexual assault, as well as Haven, an app for LGBTQ people to find safe hospitals and other services in their local areas.  In the future, I hope to create even more projects which aid marginalized people.",N/A (see cover letter)

To achieve this, I wrote scripts in MATLAB to calculate the attenuation and percent error by generating a synthetic neural signal based on patient data. Recently, I also started taking the online Coursera course from Stanford about the basics of machine learning, which included writing code in Octave/MATLAB to implement gradient descent for multivariable linear regression.

Projects included building an object-oriented design console game and unknown attack detection system that analyzed thousands of telemetry log lines. The latter implemented a disk-based hash table for information storage and retrieval. One of my favorite projects that I enjoyed was constructing the Minesweeper game from scratch in Java, where I also developed an _ÑÒautoplay_Ñ mode where the game would complete itself using a set of logic rules, and the Pente game, where I developed a program to play Pente against classmates_Ñé programs, which involved evaluating the game state and determining the best moves after each turn. Last spring quarter, I collaborated with UCLA_Ñés Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) project, developing a webpage to statistically compare the weekly weather in two cities.

In my Algorithms and Data Structures class, I became very comfortable working in Java while working on small, sophisticated projects like implementing auto-complete using tries. Then during HackDuke I created my first project from scratch, a website with an interactive game. From this I learned basics of web and game development, version control, and coding as part of a team. During this hackathon, I also learned how to work under time pressure, as we had only 24 hours to create the project.	 This summer was an immersive experience for me in terms of learning computer science and software engineering. I became proficient in VBA working as a software engineer intern for Deloitte, where I wrote various macros and toolbar functions that have since been deployed to the entire 70-person consulting group I was working with. Outside of work hours, I spent much of my time writing a simple calculator app in order to teach myself the basics of Swift and iOS app development. This was a fantastic experience to work on a project completely by myself, and through this I acquired many new problem-solving skills.	This semester I am enrolled in three computer science classes, across a range of disciplines. The first, a computer security class, has taught me how to carry out basic attacks and how servers and content delivery networks take measures to prevent such attacks. In carrying out a number of experiments in terminal, I became very comfortable working on the command line. The second is a computer architecture class, in which I learned to write C and MIPS, as well as how to build various types of circuits and even my own processor using Logisim software. My third computer science class this semester is software design and implementation, where I have been challenged more than any other class I have taken at Duke. In this course, I have learned how to work in teams of 3, 4 and 10 people, working entirely on GitLab. In our projects, I have learned the ins and outs of JavaFX, having built side-scrolling games, simulations, and a Logo interpreter.	I have loved the variety in my computer science background, and am looking forward to refining a smaller set of skills this summer as part of a team of software engineers working in industry.","I am most proficient in Java, but I_Ñém also very comfortable writing in VBA and Python.

The program included 55 women from Alpha Phi chapters throughout the United States and Canada. Through this experience, we learned leadership skills such as how to communicate effectively and productively with others in business and social settings, how to accomplish tasks, how to be more assertive in an appropriate manner in the business world, and how to conduct oneself as an ideal leader. This experience was extremely unique and beneficial, and I was able to learn leadership qualities that will certainly help guide me in the professional world. At school, I have enjoyed learning to program and write code. Particular to the business world, I enjoy working in teams and collaborating with others. In my computer science classes at Duke, I often find collaboration with my peers on projects to be a great opportunity for us to challenge one another, learn from each other, and build off of different individuals_Ñé ideas in order to work towards an even greater idea and solve problems using critical thinking and analysis.  The knowledge I have gained in class together with the experiences I have had working in the business world have prepared me for further experience in the tech environment. I am eager to continue my practical education in the business environment, and I am confident that my experience and education will enable me to be a productive member of whatever team I am fortunate to join this summer.  ","My computer programming skill set and experience lies within the courses I have taken/ am currently enrolled in.  The courses I have taken have afforded me knowledge in Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MIPS Assembly languages. ","I am particularly excited about Kick Ass Coders because the program provides a perfect vehicle through which women can work with and learn from each other and develop a support network in the business world. I am also excited about the opportunity to work further and to share with others my business experiences through participation in the program. Two summers ago, I interned at Ryder Systems, Inc. in the marketing and advertising department, and throughout last summer and the spring semester of my sophomore year, I interned at SoloPro, Inc. (now GoldenKey) as a Business Analyst & Marketing/Social Media Intern. I would like to build on my previous experiences in the business world, and broaden my areas of exposure to different companies and industries. Additionally, building on my experience using social media to drive attention to a product or business, I would be very interested in a position that would enable me to continue to develop that area of expertise and to help drive business using the exciting and creative opportunities presented by the Internet, social media, and the digital age.  ","I am currently enrolled in a User Interfaces course, which I truly enjoy. In this course, I have been working on designing websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love having the ability to design different aspects of a website and use creativity to make it look aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. This User Interfaces course has thus enhanced my interest in front-end position opportunities.Furthermore, as a computer science major, I am also interested in linking computer science and the tech world to businesses and product management. I thus believe that I would be a perfect fit for a position such as a Product Manager. I am also very interested in business operations, having had positive experiences working in advertising at Ryder Systems and directing the social media platforms for SoloPro, Inc (now GoldenKey). I thus also would be very interested in any opportunities available in areas such as advertising, social media, marketing, strategic planning, or other business operations functions in which I can use my critical thinking and technical backgrounds to be a productive member of the team.While it would be an honor just to have the opportunity to participate in the Kick Ass Coders program, I would especially value the opportunity to engage with one of the businesses in which women play a prominent role. There are many start-up companies founded by women at which I am sure it would be exciting to work. For example, Lumoid is a young company that allows consumers to test products before actually deciding to purchase them. Additionally, Way Up, Inc. is a start up company that provides a marketplace for college students looking for summer internships and part-time jobs (and whose Head of Operations and Finance is a Duke alumnus). In addition to being founded and managed by women, these companies appear to be positioned uniquely in their spaces and would afford me the opportunity to interact with and contribute to up and coming business people and their companies.  On the other end of the spectrum are the more established companies such as Apple, Intel, and Oracle, which have women in senior management. Renee James, the former President of Intel who is a member of the Carlyle Group and an Oracle Director, has been an outspoken proponent of transforming the work force into one that represents the actual population, e.g., a work force with half women and more diversity. It would be a fantastic opportunity to have a female mentor at an established company who has broad experience in the business world.  While a company managed by women (or with women in senior management) would obviously present a great mentoring opportunity, I am completely flexible and open to all opportunities, should I be fortunate enough to be selected to participate in this program.  ","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","I run a food Instagram account called @dough_licious where I post different pictures of food daily, which are taken from different restaurants from all over the world. The Instagram account has grown to have over 1,700 followers. Running this food Instagram account has helped trigger my interest in the food industry as I have had the opportunity to learn about different restaurants and their styles and about aspects such as the affect that an aesthetically pleasing presentation can have on a consumer.  This Fall semester of 2016, I am studying abroad in Madrid. My semester abroad thus far has been an incredibly enriching experience both culturally and personally. Living in a different country involves many adjustments in your life, and I have definitely grown from this experience. My experience abroad has molded me into a more well-rounded individual, with more cultural awareness and perspective. Additionally, I am extremely self-motivated, organized, and dedicated to complete whatever task I have at hand. These characteristics are very important for being successful in the real-world, and will certainly help me to succeed in the long run. Finally, I love to exercise. Everyday, I set aside time in my schedule to work out. In particular, I love going to spinning classes. Spinning classes are very fast-paced and high-energy, and I love the overall excitement of the classes. I believe that staying active provides a healthy mental outlet from life_Ñés daily stress. I have also learned that the joy of exercise is universal having now made new exercise buddies in Madrid just as I have at school in Durham, NC.","Tommy Sowers _ÑÐ CEO/Founder of SoloPro, Inc.

I have worked on several projects for computer science classes, but one of the most rewarding was a project in which I designed a computer processor. This project deepened my understanding of hardware-software interaction while also making me excited about exploring other parts of computer science that I have yet to discover. ","I have taken classes the past two semesters where we worked solely in Python. Additionally, I was a teaching assistant for the introductory computer science class in which the students use Python, so I am comfortable in that language. I have also taken classes in which we coded in Java and C, and I have done some coding in assembly-level languages. I am comfortable with HTML and CSS programming as well.","The diversity and pace of change in the technology industry can be slightly overwhelming at times, but the opportunities they create are exhilarating. The possibility of being exposed to a spectrum of companies through tours and gatherings, which is an integral part of this program, greatly appeals to me. I am confident that through these interactions, I will uncover technology areas that I will want to further pursue after graduation. I am also excited at the chance to become a part of the KAC community as a Fellow. KAC provides a support system for women that begins with living with the other fellows and continues on into our careers. As a woman, it is immensely important in an industry dominated by men to have a network of people who will support me. I believe that becoming a KAC Fellow would help me build the confidence and expertise I need to succeed.","I have not zeroed in on any specific company because the role that is available is more important to me.

In addition to the skills I have acquired from my computer science classes, I have worked on several projects that qualify my CS abilities. I have self-taught myself web development, and have used those skills to make my own site, as well as run a website for the marine science club at Duke. I additionally have had prior experience in more applications of computer science in my research. As a freshman at Duke, I worked in a high energy particle physics lab, where I was able to learn the basics of C++ and specifically, ROOT. I then applied this knowledge by creating basic models of particle collisions that would be similar to those used at particle colliders such as CERN. This was one of the first experiences that taught me the significance of computer science across fields. Upon finishing the project I realized that no matter which scientific field I chose to pursue I could always make use of computer science. ","I have been programming since my junior year of high school, when I took my first ""Intro to CS"" class. After this first experience in coding, I was so Intrigued that I signed up for AP Computer Science the following semester. Upon taking the next step into the field I was made aware of several things- that you can do almost anything with java and that only two other women had chosen to take the AP level course. Since that first year of computer science in high school I have continued my education by taking the first two classes in CS at duke, furthering my knowledge of Python and Java, respectively. Even in my non-CS classes, the research and lab components have made heavy use of programming (mainly Python).  In the coming semester, I am going to take further classes in the CS department, with the aim of taking Discrete Math and Nonlinear Dynamics. In addition to supplementing my CS degree with physics coding experience, I also try to teach myself the basics of new languages whenever possible, either on my own or by going to our Duke Innovation Co-Lab supplementary classes. In result I am proficient in html, css and R. ","I have always been very fascinated by the technology world, but have struggled to get involved. From outside, the industry always seemed intimidating to me, warding me off despite how much I knew that I enjoyed coding. Kick Ass Coders seems like a wonderful way to begin making connections in this world. Another part of this program that strongly appeals to me is the mentorship program. I think that having guidance while heading off to our first tech internships will be incredibly beneficial, especially as girl in such a male-dominated field. Lastly, I find Kick Ass Coder's emphasis on community intriguing. I have found that in any new environment, the difference between having a great experience and an okay one is largely based on your community. While having interesting work is very important in itself, I have found that it's the people you have around you that make or break your success. This is why I feel that Kick Ass Coders stands out as a program, the requirement of housing with other student interns is a great idea for fostering innovation and accomplishment. ","I am open to work in most positions, though of those previously done by Kick Ass Coders I do have one that is particularly interesting to me. I really find the work of Carbon3D to be fascinating. I think that the innovation they are providing in 3D printing is going to be vital for many fields in the coming years. Additionally, as a person with background in physics, I find their new prototyping processes particularly interesting. However, I am very open to new opportunities, and I am sure I would be able to adapt and benefit from most industry experiences available. ","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","I love backpacking and hiking. I plan trips to the blue-ridge mountains whenever I can, and at least once a year go on week long backpacking trips. While I'm at school I get to keep up this interesting up by working at Outdoor Adventures,  the Duke Outdoor Recreation group. Outdoor Adventures manages the climbing wall, hiking trips and white water kayaking. Through the program I also get to supervise the Duke Climbing wall and introduce new people to indoor climbing and belaying. I really enjoy creating things, which is one of the reasons I love computer science so much. For this same reason, I am also an avid baker. Whenever I am at home in Chicago, I make a great array of pastries, cakes, pies and macarons. There is something so satisfying to me about getting a recipe just right. A last interesting thing about myself is that I spent all of last semester studying away at the Duke Marine Lab. Environmental work has always been an interest of mine, whether I am designing solar panels in my physics classes or going to workshops at the Duke Smart Home. Going to the marine lab was a great way for me to spend time immersed in conservation research while still getting to exercise my computer science skills for analysis in an entirely new field.

At UIUC, I_Ñéve taken most of the core computer science curriculum but I have also furthered my interest in the field by taking electives that sparked interest. Through the core curriculum, I learned better coding practices, the theory behind data structures and operating systems, and practiced my skills in different languages.

We redesigned the database and rebuilt it from the ground up. This was an exciting project to work on since I got to work on code that would go straight into use at a company.  ","Most of the coursework at UIUC is backend oriented, but many of the projects I have worked on have been full stack mostly working in web development. I have dabbled in Android some. I prefer to do either backend or full stack. ","For decades now, the numbers of women in tech have been declining. Companies and universities have started noticing this and are doing more outreach to help support women going into tech. Though there has been increased activism through conferences such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing and outreach through universities, there is still a long way to go. I realized this coming into UIUC and decided to do as much as I can the change the stereotype and support other women in tech. I joined Women in Computer Science, and started planning/volunteering to help high schoolers better understand what it means to study computer science. I_Ñéve been active on social media on pages such as Ladies Storm Hackathons to help other women at universities get opportunities. I want to see the numbers of women in tech raise since there is are so many prospects and innovation in technology as it becomes increasingly popular with the public.

That project allowed me to develop my design and programming skills to create a website that was intuitive but also functional and responsive. I've also been developing iOS apps since my Freshman year through CUAppDev, a student run project team that develops apps for the community. As part of that project team, I've worked on large code bases and understand the workflow to contribute to a large repository.  Because of CUAppDev I know how to use Git with a large repository and many contributing developers.

In terms of technical skill, I have experience in both Python and Java programming languages. My classes and participation in Hackathons have given me in-depth comprehension of writing algorithms and program evaluation. Specifically, I have mastered key data structures, developed proper API, and understood the importance of algorithmic efficiency. Furthermore, I possess strong critical thinking and problem solving ability, as demonstrated by my advanced mathematics coursework. My high level of mathematical ability enables me to think logically, in a step-by-step manner, in order to arrive at a rational solution. Finally, unique strengths that I possess are my capability to think creatively and compelling collaboration and interpersonal skills. As a dancer and artist throughout my life, I have always strived to think originally, paying great attention to details. I attempt to push past conventional boundaries to produce something unique, by considering new approaches, mediums, and methods. For example, I am currently on a competitive dance team and continuously strive to shape choreography that has not been seen before. This is a skill that also applies to computer science, as it is important to branch out and develop solutions that are not generic and _ÑÒone-size-fits-all_Ñ. I use the fundamentals taught in class as a launch point for innovation so that I can deliver better final programs. In addition, I have developed core communication skills through experience gained at my previous summer internship. Last summer, I worked in Kolkata, India to support underprivileged individuals living in urban slums. Interacting with individuals from a different culture and varying backgrounds, I learned to communicate effectively with people who think contrastingly and have distinct viewpoints, an invaluable skill when working with others in any setting. In computer science, collaboration is necessary in order to create a holistic product that is much greater than the individual pieces alone as well as for personal growth through continuous feedback from others. ","My comprehensive computer science coursework at Duke has developed my programming skill set. I have 1 year of experience of coding in both Java and Python, which has allowed me to thoroughly understand both object-oriented programming and scripted language programming. My computer science classes have taught me extensively about data structures, important algorithms such as various sorting, Djestra_Ñés, and Kruskal_Ñés algorithms, and algorithmic efficiency analysis. Notable complex projects that I have completed are developing a program that uses Markov models to generate random text based on training texts and creating simulations of planetary motion and restriction enzyme cleaving a DNA molecule. These and other projects demonstrate my comprehension of fundamental data structures and abstract data types including Arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, HashMaps, TreeMaps, Binary Trees, Stacks, and Queues. I have also learned extensively about efficiency analysis and importance of writing code that is not only effective but also swift. For example, in my Data Structures and Algorithms class, each project requires a complementary analysis report that assesses the efficiency of the algorithms that are utilized Additionally, I am proficient in the implementation of important programming techniques and concepts including recursion, memorization, inheritance, abstraction, Boolean logic, iterations/loops, and more. Furthermore, I have a strong background in mathematics, through taking both Multivariable Calculus and Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science. These classes have enabled me to develop advanced quantitative ability, which is essential for the implementation of complex algorithms. Next semester, I will be continuing to develop my computer science skillset through taking Computer Architecture, which covers advanced topics in computer system design and organization, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and Linear Algebra for computer science, which discusses the key concepts of linear algebra and how to directly apply them to computer software. ","Kick Ass Coders will provide me with a meaningful summer experience that will enable to grow enormously. Specifically, I will be actively contributing to a product through various projects, thereby enabling me to gain experience outside of the classroom. Because I will be able to directly assist in the completion of a project, I will be able to illustrate and improve my technical and problem solving abilities in a professional setting. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to collaborate with experienced software engineers, who can provide me with constant feedback. By giving me specific recommendations on how I can improve, this feedback will allow me to learn immensely and grow as a software engineer. Furthermore, the mentorship provided by Kick Ass Coders will be invaluable as I navigate through a new and unfamiliar industry. In particular, the mentorship will enable me to advance my coding skillset, answer questions that I have, and guide me through various situations that arise in a professional environment. Through activities such as talking with guest speakers, taking relevant coding tutorials, discussing female-related issues, and attending professional development workshops, I will receive relevant information and learn from the experience of others, which will prepare me for both future computer science courses and my future career. In addition, as a woman going into a male-dominated field, being part of a strong community of women with similar interests will prove highly beneficial. Together, we can discuss issues of women in the workplace, any anxieties that we have, and more. Through mentorship and meeting new people, I will be able to expand both my network as well as my thinking. I will be able gain access to different lenses and see things from new perspectives, thereby showing me new approaches to solve complex problems.  ","A specific position that I am interested in working as is a Software Engineering Intern because of my passion for coding and software design. As a Computer Science major, I want to experience coding outside of the classroom. Having the opportunity to work in software design and implementation will enable me to better understand the job of a software engineer and the company culture of a tech business. In particular, a specific company that I would like to intern with is Uber. I have always wanted to work in a place that directly enhances people_Ñés lives. As an intern at Uber, I will have the opportunity to work on Uber_Ñés product to directly improve both the customer and driver experiences. Furthermore, Uber continuously attempts to push conventional boundaries in order to redefine the way in which individuals interact with technology. When Uber first launched, the idea behind the application was unconventional, and now Uber is an integral part of the daily lives of people globally. Uber has not settled to stop with merely its application but also has expanded through projects such as driverless cars. I am fascinated by how Uber constantly strives to explore uncharted territories and innovates in order to revolution the transportation industry and create large scale change in the world.  In addition, I am fascinated by mobile application development, and through an internship at Uber, I will be able to gain hands-on experience in this area. Through assisting in advancing Uber_Ñés application, I will be able to utilize both my technological skills and business acumen. In order to design and implement a better user experience, I will have to consider both what the consumer wants (from the business perspective) and then turn those wishes into reality (which is the tech aspect). I think that Uber will provide me with both challenging and rewarding work that will enable me to grow immensely throughout the summer. Finally, Uber has a strong company culture that I would love to be a part of.  ","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","1.	I am an avid dancer and have danced since the age of five. I have experimented with different dance styles and am currently on a dance team at Duke, on which I perform on the competitive team and assist with choreography. Last semester, in addition to several on-campus performances we had the opportunity to attend a competition at Columbia University in New York City. I hope to continue to pursue dance in the future and am planning on taking a dance class at Duke next semester in order to improve my form, flexibility, and technique. 2.	Travelling is my passion and I hope to one day have the chance to explore all seven continents. I think the world is full of such incredible people, sites, and cultures, and I want to experience all of them. My love for traveling was cultivated from a young age, as my dad had a job which required him to travel frequently and he would always come home with fascinating objects like a wooden pillow from Africa and Ukrainian dolls. I love seeking adventures and want to someday backpack through unknown places to learn more about the world.  3.	Promoting STEM education for girls is a cause that is incredibly important to me and that I attempt to actively contribute to support. For example, this past summer, I lead engineering classes for women in a slum community in Kolkata, India. I helped educate the women on how to build basic rechargeable flashlights step-by-step from start to finish. In particular, my group and I taught them how to construct the circuit using various components, solder all the parts together, create the motor for the recharging element, fashion the casing, and finally assemble all the pieces together to form a cohesive flashlight. At Duke, I participate in a program called Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science (FEMMES) to engage girls from a young age in STEM through after-school programs. In the future, I want to continue to advance STEM education and strive to become a role model for young girls to work towards closing the gender gap in STEM. I hope in small ways, I can develop sustainable change for future generations of females.

At the beginning of last summer, I did not yet have the technical skills required for a technology internship, however, I was able to do an internship at the intersection of technology and marketing. I learned marketing skills and content development skills while widening my knowledge of exciting technical subjects such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I not only learned how to research different technical subjects, but also how to write about them for articles and blogs that were published on the company_Ñés website. I had weekly meetings with the CEO and regularly interacted with both the CTO and the Senior Vice President of Operations. My internship gave me an advanced understanding of the day to day workings of a small technical company. With the additional skills acquired from my additional year at Duke, I am now perfectly equipped to work in a technology company in a more technical role.","At Duke I am double majoring in electrical and computer engineering and computer science. Thus in addition to taking the computer science classes of any computer science student, I complement my studies with engineering classes that further improve my critical thinking and problem solving skills. This enables me to more efficiently approach the complex problems I encounter in my computer science classes. In my computer science and engineering classes, I have learned MATLAB, Java, C, and Assembly Language. I have also learned how to use Eclipse, Arduino, and Logism.","The four pillars of the Kick Ass Coders Program resonate with me in many different ways. While the internship is the core of the program, I believe that the training, mentorship, and community aspect are equally, if not more, important. An internship is the best way to learn what position or career might be right for you, and when this is coupled with training in leadership skills, I think that the young women who complete the Kick Ass Coders Program are truly equipped to handle any situation and jump-start their careers. I am a naturally outgoing person, however when it comes to situations or working environments in which you are a minority, I know confidence is key. Teaching women to be proud and confident in all of their endeavors, work related or not, is essential to increasing the number of women that pursue tech careers. Not only do young women need to be confident and learn leadership skills, but they must also have a support system.	The Kick Ass Coders Program highlights two important components of a support system: community and mentorship. Completing difficult tasks or entering new stages in your life is much easier when you have a group of people experiencing similar things. I believe that the program_Ñés emphasis on building a community is a great way to not only network and make friends, but also ensure that each participants gets the most out of her internship. When a participant feels supported, she will be more likely to challenge herself and take risks which will lead to a more rewarding internship experience. Additionally, having a mentor makes entering a new environment much easier. Not only are mentors great for advice and help when needed, but they often become the best role models. During my freshman year at Duke, I did an extensive research project on why there are so few women in STEM. For a large part of the final paper, I discussed how a lack of role models for young women contributes to this discrepancy. Building mentorship into the Kick Ass Coders Program guarantees an additional resource for the participants and an additional role model. For these reasons, I am drawn to the Kick Ass Coders Program and want to be a part of its continued development.","I am open to all types of positions. My main priority is having a position that will challenge me and present me with many learning opportunities.

I learned that staring at your code when you're stuck often leads to more issues than resolutions. My first computer science teacher told me that projects are 90% thought and 10% code, and from her I learned that using brute force to churn out answers never works. In compsci 201 I furthered my proficiency in Java and took on more complex projects. We not only produced code, but we had to understand it. With every project we submitted an analysis as well because it was not just about finding an answer. It was about finding the most efficient answer and understanding how to get there. In compsci 230 I learned Python and an even more analytical side of computer science.

Some of the amazing things I learned about Stripe_Ñés API include the following. The Stripe API supports a wide range of payment methods such as Alipay and Bitcoin as well as both Android and iOS platforms. The company believes in one-click payments and other user-friendly frontend features that really aim to provide the users with positive payment experience. What amazes me is how much thought is put into embedding subtle animations into the payment process that helps the flow and enhances positive experience. (Here are two links to such animations: https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1600/1*srx-Hz7Lo2Pk4QUkT7-sIQ.gif, https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1600/1*nZHN1WhK5COMRn-aT4UYvg.gif ). Another interesting function of Stripe_Ñés API is that it utilizes machine learning for fraud detection, making this API extremely safe. It does so by analyzing massive amount of characteristics pertaining to each payment and uses classification algorithms to detect potential frauds. Because these wonderful features of Stripe_Ñés API, I would like to be on Stripe_Ñés engineering team in order to contribute to this amazing product and help make people_Ñés online payment process even better.Apple -  Software Engineer Intern: When I think about Apple, two words always come to mind: innovation and human-oriented. I am a Mac and iPhone user. I love my Apple products and love the way they are making my life better. My favorite product is the MacBook. The Mac OS operating system is the key component that makes the human-computer interaction pleasant and makes a MacBook different from other PCs. With world class GUI design, the system is really intuitive to use and not to mention, visually attractive. In company with outstanding hardwares such as the smooth touchpad and retina display screen, the MacBook is a piece of art with extremely practical uses. The Mac OS is a two-layered system: the GUI is built upon a Unix core, which is very reliable in its security features. Destructive trojan or virus cannot be installed on the laptop unless the user explicitly allows root access by entering the admin password. Furthermore, the terminal access in Mac OS is easy due to its Unix kernel. Since using terminal commands has the same effects as many common operations (for instance, creating a new directory in terminal is the same as creating a new folder by right-click), it is easier to visualize what the terminal does and learn the powerful command line tools on Mac OS. And at last, the Mac OS integrates well with other Apple products which makes data sharing (the AirDrop feature) and application management (iCloud backup) extremely easy. With these reasons, I am interested to learn more about the Mac OS and other embedded features through an internship at Apple. I also hope to learn from top talents in the world and be inspired to innovate and improve technology products.Within data science I am interested in the following aspects:Massive-scale data mining and data analysis to extract useful business insights;Backend software engineering to automate data processing;Use machine learning to automate data analysis and decision making.Companies where I would like to intern:Facebook - Data Scientist, Analyst: I am interested in data analyst position at Facebook because with more and more diverse apps and functions, Facebook is handling a more massive amount of data than most companies nowadays. The different types of data include user demographics, interaction statistics, app download statistics, revenue, and many more. The Facebook Analytics platform is a powerful tool that collects useful raw data and turn them into simple but thorough data visualizations. I am amazed by how much we could learn from data after serious analysis and I am thrilled to see what Facebook has accomplished. The results of data analysis can be used to drive business decisions, improve apps and even give insights into product design. I would like to be part of such a movement to utilize data to the biggest extent.Fanatics - Data Analyst: After talking to a classmate who interned at Fanatics last summer, I learned more about the company and about the data analyst position. The task of the internship was large-scale data mining to figure out the best time to send out promotional emails to customers. This kind of real world challenge is really interesting. Fanatics deals with many similar challenges with the amount of data it needs to handle, for instance, tracking, message queues, real time streaming, which makes data analytics an integral part of the company. I am eager for an opportunity there to work on these tasks and look for useful information that benefits the firm.","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","1. The past summer I worked on a solution architecture of a grocery store shopping app that aims to reduce the time customers have to spend in the store. The app can be downloaded on personal mobile phones and be used to scan items with their barcodes and create shopping orders as the customers shop. Once the customers finish shopping, they can submit the order through in-store WiFi. Though the idea was simple, our solution was innovative in the following ways. a) Every customer has one and only one account that corresponds to his or her membership number. During first-time registration, the account will also be tied to the mobile number, making later multifactor authentication for login possible. The app allows the customers to pay in one of the two ways: either on the phone or using the unmanned checkout kiosk. They can choose to store payment information on the account. All sensitive data about the cards are tokenized and stored in a vault secured through encryption. Neither the grocery store nor the bank actually stores the card credentials. What the grocery store has access to are just the tokens which are random strings that do not have any particular meaning without specific algorithms to decrypt. This way the store can minimize the loss of important payment information in case of backend storage system being hacked. b) Node.js is the selected backend due its ability to handle asynchronous input and output. Thus it is a good choice for real time asynchronous interactions and would be able to manage 1000 concurrent users making transactions. Furthermore, Node.js_Ñés event loop allows all intensive input and output operations to be performed asynchronously, which allows for scaling to large volumes of clients.c) We choose Stripe_Ñés API to provide seamless support for online payments which supports Apple Pay and Android Pay. Stripe supports payment methods including ACH, Alipay, and Bitcoin which other payment APIs such as Braintree do not support. Stripe is also extremely secure in that important credit card data is never sent to the server, which is automatically PCI compliant as the server will not handle any sensitive data. This information would instead be stored in a vault. 2. I first came to America as an American Field Service Exchange student sophomore year, and had lived in three host families throughout my high school career. Accommodating to a new society and living with people I never knew before were truly challenging. However,these experiences helped me grow rapidly toward an independent young adult and learn to adjust to any new environment quickly. I am grateful for the chance to spend my high school years in America as I gained not only academic knowledge but also insight into adapting to and appreciating new cultures.3. My friend and I got to know two Cuban ladies who worked in a restaurant during the Grace Hopper conference. One of them spoke more English but did not have much education. The other had been a successful lawyer in Cuba with her own office until she was forced to leave the country due to political unrest. They told us life was very hard because of limited skills or education, even though they worked hard everyday. On the last day when we said farewell, they kept telling us the importance of pursuing a higher education and living the most out of a life. It was only at this moment that I realized how blessed I am to study at Duke and to pursue a degree in tech. I often forget to appreciate the opportunity to be educated and be supported by great parents. There are many people like the two ladies who desire better education to improve themselves but not able to obtain any. I rarely get to talk to people at the bottom of the society, but their desire to learn was even stronger than some students I knew. It was a moment that made me think in the future I might be able to use compute science to provide people like them with better education resources (educational platform), and help them accommodate to a new environment. And at this moment I realized that tech can also be used to resolve social issues, not just generating innovation.

Choosing not only a correct, but the most efficient and appropriate solution to a problem is a skill that I learned in Computer Science 201, and have continued to practice this semester in Computer Science 230, as the professor has given us many open-ended, and at times intentionally ambiguous questions that leave the student to find the best answer. As this is reflective of real-life programming problems, which may not be well-defined, and a solution may not be known, my analytical skills and logical thought processes have been sharpened by these difficult problems. Computer Science 201 and 230 have also exposed me to the underlying implementations of useful and interesting projects like Markov Model text generation, autocompletion algorithms, machine learning, and predicting stock market trends by computing stock option probabilities. During my job as an undergraduate teaching assistant for Computer Science 101, the ability to quickly understand and explain a problem to a student that asks me for help is an essential skill, and it forces me to analyze a problem and find a solution on the spot - and then be able to articulate it so the student can understand it themselves. As a member of the web team for The Standard, a digital-only publication at Duke that publishes lifestyle and fashion content, I have had experience collaborating with an interdisciplinary team, cooperating with them to create a website that caters to the needs of the publication and its viewers, but also operates efficiently as a web page.

Both of these classes, combined with my own outside exploration and planning/attending a design thinking conference last year, gave me in insight into design concepts regarding aesthetics, branding, and the user_Ñés experience. I have found these skills to be extremely useful for at hackathons and for developing websites. Furthermore, being the inequality track team lead for HackDuke, the nation_Ñés largest student-run philanthropic hackathon, has been extremely helpful in expanding my views on how tech can be (and can_Ñét be) used for social good. While this will not be directly related to all tech internship, I would love to see more tech companies find a way to bridge gaps in social issues, and be a part of that.","     Haven taken courses where Python and Java were used, I am most comfortable coding in those languages and the application of data structures in Java. I have a little experience with C as well. I also have an understanding of computer architecture and have coded in assembly language. Outside of class, I am extremely interested in UI and UX programming. On my own, I have dug through the treasures of the internet and read many articles about design thinking and user experience, and taught myself HTML/CSS, which have come in handy when coding interfaces at hackathons and with the personal website I am currently building. At the last hackathon I attended, I dabbled with iOS programming, so I know a little bit about Swift too.  ","     Over the summer, I worked as part of a female empowerment team with a group of girls in a small town of Ernakulam in India, with part of the work being in physical education classes with them. In just one month, they improved from not knowing how to dribble to making their three-pointers. Above all, the outcomes of that month were tangible manifestations of the amount of confidence the girls instilled in themselves through just learning a simple game and having someone show them they could.      Recently, a nonprofit organization popularized the idea of _ÑÒthe girl effect._Ñ Long story short, it_Ñés the concept that other than gender equality being a basic human right, giving girls the same opportunities as males and increasing their self-esteem through education has an effect on not just themselves, but their peers, communities, and countries. Being with the girls in Ernakulam allowed me to first handedly experience the beginning of the girl effect. When the girls challenged the boys to a game, I saw the boys practicing more to get better, rather than just goofing around. With their new-found self-confidence, the girls did things they would have never imagined doing before and influenced everyone around them.      This journey of mutual inspiration affirmed to me the power of someone coming along and telling a young girl they can do it and the number of people that girl will go on to encourage. Confidence boosters and realizations of our potential like this are exactly what women in technology need to perpetuate the cultural shift of men and women being seen as equally capable. Being totally surrounded by women and allies who share the same drive to push for gender equality inside and outside of the tech world is so empowering, and something I have yet to experience outside of all-female hackathons. Kick Ass Coders lets girls are passionate the same goals echo each other_Ñés ideas, build each other up, and form a support system that will extend past the 30 fellows to the tech community, all while actively participating in what they love. I want to be part of this movement and break the stigma that tech is not for females. I want to form connections like I did in Ernakulum as a part of Kick Ass Coders and see the girl effect take off even further and light up every it touches. ","I am most interested in front-end or UI/UX engineering, but would like to learn more about back-end and mobile engineering as well. If I could choose anywhere to intern, it would be at Spotify. Spotify has been a big part of my life since 2012 and catalyzed and fed the growth to my love for music. It made music so accessible for a young girl whose world was built upon the music she loved, and for millions of others around the world. I love what Spotify stands for at its core. Equally important, in the light of recent events, I feel the need of a safe space more than ever. Spotify not only creates that space, but perpetuates change as well through events like Diversify, a relatively progressive parental leave policy, encouraging queer rights, and more. The combination of a product I love and a culture that sees the same priority in combatting social issues as I do makes me want to contribute and grow at Spotify more than at any other place.","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","-	I am a huge Studio Ghibli enthusiast.

As a first-generation Asian-American, my culture is extremely important to me, and there are a lot of stereotypes regarding East Asian culture and being Asian-American that are offensive and misleading. Often times, these misconceptions simply stem from the lack of discussion and education on the issues. Being able to relate to and talk about this with my children is refreshing and brings me closer to something that means a lot to me. I think having open discussions is the first step in breaking down the misconceptions, and the parent/child system and ASA pave a way for that.

Although our statistics are growing, female coders still make up such a small portion of the industry's demographic, and I appreciate how Kick Ass Coders takes action to break that trend. At Duke I'm a Baldwin Scholar, which is a scholars program that fosters female empowerment and leadership. By being in this program, I have been able to experience firsthand how wonderful and crucial it is for women to lift each other up and work together to break the gender gap in all aspects of life. In the classroom, there have been times when I've felt pressured to be perfect so I don't conform to the stereotype that ""women can't handle STEM."" There have even been instances when my male colleagues have exhibited a complete disregard for my abilities as a coder on the basis of my gender. These experiences have definitely been disheartening in the sense that I know they will not be the last time I face such discrimination. For this reason, the mission of Kick Ass Coders resonates so deeply with me: it eliminates these negative biases and recognizes that female coders have just as much potential and prowess in STEM.","I would love to intern at Snapchat!

I learned ChucK, a language that enables real-time audio synthesis and on-the-fly programming. I also learned Max/MSP, a visual programming language that helps create musical pieces and applications for music production, and PureData, a language similar to Max/MSP. Through group projects, I also learned about networking with audio. For my final project, I decided to work on hardware and created a sampling pad using piezoelectric sensors, Arduino boards, and Max/MSP. Now I'm working on learning C++ so that I can develop my own audio VST/AU plugins for music producers. In my current general computer science class, I have learned programming in Java. I have also learned about basic machine language, performance tests, and algorithm design.","I am most comfortable programming in Java. I had a quick introduction to Python in high school, although I have not used it yet since.

I attended an all-girls school that deliberately trained us to overcome stereotype threat. Ever since coming to college, I have realized that the real world is not so deliberate in promoting confidence in women.

Similarly, my employment as an Introduction to Programming (COMP 110) teaching assistant has also enhanced my conceptual understanding of Java by having students throw questions that I may not have thought too much about, as well as by enforcing _ÑÒblack-out hours,_Ñ which is a policy that requires us to explain code to students by using whiteboards, rather than look directly at their code. My involvement in TEDxUNC on the technology committee has also developed my coding skills by exposing me to new languages and frameworks while developing our website from scratch. I_Ñéve become familiar with Node, Jade, and Git. Furthermore, my most recent experience at a local hackathon, HackNC, included a project that attempted to develop a web app similar to AirBnb for parking spots, and exposed me to new languages such as Ruby on Rails and Javascript, as well as tools such as API_Ñés that I was not too familiar with. This was in addition to the HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap coding I used based on prior knowledge while I was working on the front-end development side.Programming aside, skills that I have developed include interpersonal and time-management skills. In addition to working as a teaching assistant, I_Ñém also an administrative assistant at the UNC Student Union. Working at the front desk and answering phone calls, in addition to working as a teaching assistant, has allowed me to become pretty good at communicating anything from explaining code to where the nearest bathroom is, as well as keeping a conversation. Communication is important because programming emphasizes teamwork, and without it, the inability to give input and receive feedback on code can negatively impact the final product. My job at the Student Union has also influenced my emphasis on time-management. Although I have other coworkers, we only work one person shifts. Therefore, if I come in late, no one else is there to get the job done, so I_Ñéve come to believe that punctuality is crucial. This is especially important with any job because deadlines are oftentimes not flexible.","I am proficient in Java, HTML, CSS, and using Bootstrap framework. I am currently learning, and therefore have a basic working knowledge of, Python and Javascript.","I am interested in this program because of the access to all the different resources. I decided that I wanted to become a programmer not too long ago, so this industry is still very new to me. I look forward to the mentorship program because it would be extremely helpful to have someone to help navigate the field. Furthermore, I would love to have the extra field experience and work on projects that will allow me to gain valuable skillsets. I_Ñém always eager to learn new languages, as well as develop my knowledge of the ones I already know. Overall, I favor the ability to network with other women in the industry. Creating bonds with people who are a minority like I am is something that is motivating and propels me to work harder and make a presence in the computer science field.","My end goal is to work in cybersecurity, so if I am able to secure an internship in that field, I would be grateful and ecstatic. However, because I know that cybersecurity requires a lot of extra knowledge and skills that I may not currently possess, I plan on initially working in development to gain those basic skills so that I can transition into cybersecurity later on. I am interested in cybersecurity because keeping information private is a hot topic these days. Banks, especially, have the need to ensure that their data is kept private. From what I have gathered about it, it seems like an area where I'll constantly be on my toes because I have to predict potential threats and address them before they happen, which is something that I believe I would enjoy. Development is something I am interested in because it is programming-intensive. I enjoy coding because every program is like a puzzle full of lines of code. I easily lose track of time whenever I am coding, so being able to do that for a living is something I would definitely be satisfied with.","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham","I_Ñém a second-degree black belt in taekwondo, I have played both the violin and clarinet for over a decade, and my spirit animal is a fox!","Kris Jordan, Introduction to Programming (COMP 110) Lecturer, 919-590-6041, kris@cs.unc.edu, Former Teacher/BossCasey Weakland, Carolina Union Executive Assistant, 919-962-0984, cmweakla@email.unc.edu, Boss"

The students we taught were the most advanced in their classes who were willing to come to school during one of their breaks just to learn from us. While we taught grammar, the parts of the trip that I remember most were reading my favorite childhood books to the students, experiencing a culture in which students love to go to school every day, and learning to communicate through a language barrier. I became so close to one of the students that when she asked me to sponsor her through secondary school, I couldn_Ñét say no. When I got home, I held bake sales and other fundraisers to raise the money to put Veronica, through school. In a village where most young girls get married and have kids at a very young age, it was a privilege to help one change that tradition and continue with her education. My senior year of high school and sixth year taking Spanish, I was given the opportunity to host a Spanish exchange student, America, for three weeks.

The charred earring, the blackened outlet, and the perturbed expression on my mother_Ñés face after the accident stayed with me for years. Since then, my curiosity has pushed me to discover everything there is to know about the world, and ask questions at every conceivable opportunity. My curiosity has developed into my passion for solving problems, especially through technical or quantitative thinking. As a logical thinker with a desire to create an impact on the world, I am interested in Kick Ass Coders because I want to learn about the practical applications of computer programming in a real world under the guidance of a mentor. Since I ultimately want to pursue a data-driven career in the technology industry, Kick Ass Coders would be a phenomenal segway for me from coding in the classroom to coding in industry.

I never would have thought I would become a computer science major before coming to Wesleyan. To be honest, I didn_Ñét even really know what computer science was. I had originally embarked on my college career thinking that I would declare the physics major, but later juggled this option with mathematics and computer science as well. All of these fields had one thing in common: they were male dominated. While all scientific fields in general consist of an unfortunately low proportion of women, I have always been more inclined to and felt a greater aptitude for the sciences that exhibit an especially uneven gender ratio - while many of my female friends are pursuing their interests in chemistry or biology and are on a pharmacy track or aspire to become doctors, I cannot say the same for physics or computer science. In fact, I do not have any female friends who have declared or intend to declare a major in physics or computer science. As a female computer science major, I_Ñéve often been told that I will have to _ÑÒfight harder_Ñ or that I_Ñém _ÑÒunusual_Ñ simply due to the combination of my gender and my choice of major. Some of my friends forget that I am a computer science major and have told me that I just don_Ñét seem like a _ÑÒscience person,_Ñ which agitates me because it dismisses my passion and subdues my hope of pursuing my passion.As all of my friends who are fellow computer science majors are male, they do not and cannot fully understand my struggle as a woman venturing into computer science. I intentionally hold myself back from opening up to them about the struggles I have in understanding class material or completing a programming assignment, because I am constantly trying to prove that I as a woman am just as capable as men in computer science. It may sound silly but I envy my male classmates for being able to tell me _ÑÒI didn_Ñét really understand that concept we learned in class_Ñ or _ÑÒI_Ñém having trouble with this homework problem,_Ñ because I_Ñém not able to say the same so easily to them. I don_Ñét want to give them the impression that I may be not as bright because I_Ñém a woman. I just hate the thought that they might attribute my performance to my gender. Even knowing that my male friends are probably struggling with their computer science coursework just as much as I am, I still do not feel comfortable voicing my struggles to them because I_Ñém constantly burdened by the need to prove myself to be better than my male counterparts in order to gain their recognition and respect. It_Ñés an unfortunate situation, but I feel like they won_Ñét give me credit unless I _ÑÒbeat_Ñ the stereotype.That_Ñés why being able to participate in the Kick Ass Coders program would be a dream come true for me. If I were to delve into computer science with a community of other young women who understand where I_Ñém coming from, I would be freed from the need to cover up or to try to explain myself all the time. I could openly voice my questions, share my opinions, and collaborate with females who I would be living with and connecting with on a basis of mutual understanding. Having been suffocated by self-preservation efforts to package myself and my abilities as pleasantly as possible for so long, I would love to let go of all that and just be allowed to be myself - myself with all my problems, my aspirations, my fears, my questions - surrounded by a supportive group of kickass women who are all in this together. I try not to show it to anybody else but if I be honest with myself, I can see that I_Ñéve somewhat fallen for the lies that males are simply more naturally attuned to STEM fields. What I need to do right now is to build my confidence in my ability as a person who is able to do what she loves and to do it well. That_Ñés why for me, it_Ñés extremely important to have a mentor who has been through something similar to what I_Ñém going through and can show me that I can get through this and that things will work out by sharing her own life experience and guiding me in my decision making. I have high expectations for this opportunity, and believe that the lessons and relationships gained through this program will not only impact its participants for the duration of a year but for the rest of their lives.","Speaking honestly, I do not consider myself knowledgeable enough about the different positions available to request a specific type of position. I do not have a preference for a specific company, either.","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","(1) I am a fraternal twin, although many people think my twin sister and I are identical twins. Having grown up together prior to college, we were always together. We attended the same school, got involved in the same extracurricular activities, and shared the same friend group. Our lives were deeply interconnected, because we had not spent more than a 24 hour period apart from each other before we headed off to college. Going to different colleges was an intentional choice we had both decided on way before we even began applying to colleges. Not because we hated each other (we_Ñére the bestest of friends, I assure you) but we wanted to each find our own person and discover who we could be without the pressure of constantly being juxtaposed in comparison by people who expect us to b entirely the same (Well, she_Ñés an art history major and I_Ñém a computer science major. Plus, she hates red beans while I adore them. That automatically sets us apart, doesn_Ñét it?) or polar opposites (We are still related, after all. Wake up call: not every twin pair has to have a good twin and an evil twin, people.). The whole college thing was a gradual transition. We called each other every single day our first semester of college, often for hours on end. Now, I_Ñém able to go on for weeks at a time without relaying every single detail of my life to my sister, and I don_Ñét even suffer from withdrawal anymore. I have learned so much from my college experience thus far, too much to detail here, but I have a long way to go and am still in the process of discovering who I am, who I_Ñém meant to be. (2) I am enthusiastic about Japanese studies, which is why I intend to declare a double major in the College of East Asian Studies (CEAS). I am currently a declared Computer Science and Mathematics double major, but I feel that a Computer Science and CEAS double major would be a truer reflection of my varied interests. I had always been drawn to Japanese language and culture, but did not seriously pursue these interests until I came to Wesleyan. Two weeks before I began my college career, my mother shared with me and my sister the groundbreaking news that we are part Japanese, one-eighth to be exact. I_Ñém not sure exactly why she waited 18 years to do so, but I suppose everything happens the way it does for a reason. Anyhow, that incident solidified my desire to engage in Japanese studies as an attempt to explore my roots. So, I started taking elementary Japanese as a freshman and fell in love with the language and culture. I was unable to continue my Japanese language studies as a sophomore and decided to study abroad in Osaka, Japan this summer to cover the material I had missed my sophomore year. Japan was amazing on so many levels and exceeded my already high expectations in terms of food, hospitality, transportation, scenery, and most of all, the people. If I had the chance to go back, I would do so in a heartbeat. Currently, I am the Hall Manager of Japanese Hall, a residential hall on campus that houses students who are committed to the mission of creating programs that introduce, convey, and celebrate Japanese culture on campus.(3) I attended a magnet high school called Bergen County Academies (BCA). As its name suggests, it was made up of various _ÑÒacademies,_Ñ which were the equivalent of departments or majors in college terms. I was a student of the Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology (AAST). As a member of the _ÑÒscience academy,_Ñ I had to complete a rigorous curriculum of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering courses that ranged from two to four years of study for each subject as opposed to the usual one year per subject required at most other American high schools. Computer science, however, was not included in that curriculum, but I wish it had been. There was actually a separate academy called the Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS), that was dedicated to the study of computer science. Although computer science courses were available as electives to people outside of the _ÑÒcomputer science academy,_Ñ it seemed that these courses still mainly consisted of ATCS students. I unfortunately never took such a course during my high school years because I didn_Ñét think it was necessary, and moreover, I didn_Ñét think it would particularly interest me.My senior year of high school, several of the ATCS students collaborated to start up hackBCA, one of the first high school hackathons in the nation. I knew it was a big deal because many of the hotshot companies, including Intel and Microsoft, were getting behind the event as sponsors and many of the notable figures in tech, including reddit co-founder Alex Ohanian, Vine co-founder Colin Kroll, and Flatiron School CTO Sara Chipps, were coming in as judges for the hackathon. The only reason I went to school on the weekend of the hackathon was because my multivariable calculus professor arranged a meeting for our class with Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Mathematica, who had come to demo the new Wolfram language at the hackathon. I left directly after the meeting, right before the hackathon officially began.I seriously regret not having taken the chance to participate in the hackathon now and wish I had walked away with more than just a hackathon logo T-shirt (albeit a very comfortable one that I use as pajamas). I was scared to enter unfamiliar territory, especially since not many of my friends, who were mostly female, had registered for the event. That first year, only 17% of the hackathon participants were female and since then, there have been efforts to increase the proportion of female hackers in the event but by then, it was too late for me because I had graduated. I so wish that someone had personally invited me to participate, or even forced me to register, because such a momentous event could have easily set me on the path I later discovered for myself at an earlier onset. I would like to give back to my community and contribute to a future hackBCA event in some capacity as a coach, or perhaps even a judge or emcee. It would be amazing if I were allowed to provide a talk or workshop tailored to encouraging and mentoring young female beginner programmers. I want to give girls the exposure and confidence boost that I so wish I had received when I was at that stage in their lives. I realize I still do need more of that exposure and confidence, however, even as a college student, which is why I believe the endeavors of Kick Ass Coders are just as crucial for female college students as hackBCA can be for high school girls.","Victoria Manfredi, Dr., 860-685-2194, vumanfredi@wesleyan.edu, current Computer Science course professor"

I have been working as a teaching assistant for Java programming language. Also, I have developed my own SMTP server by using python. In addition, I am familiar with assembly language too. During the summer, I worked at the security lab that mainly analyzes assembly language and converts it back to C++. ","In my room, every Wednesday is Wackadoodle Wednesday: the HEAD team gets together to continue work on our multi-touch mobile game. As the semester has progressed, I have come to see this as my calling. Initially, our primary concern was producing creative behaviors, scenes, and effects. After endless cycles of writing codes, staring at the terminal, and fixing statements, we finally launched a pre-beta version. Improving it was not so easy. As I searched for ways to upgrade our game, I realized that we had overlooked a factor: information system. Today, there is an overwhelming emphasis on software. What we often neglect is the importance of knowing how to use it efficiently. For instance, universities usually buy blank software. Then, information technology allows them to customize it to control little things like allowing students to set up different tuition payment systems. At the same time, IT analysis can significantly improve online data by filtering useful information and supplementing flaws. From this, I realized that our software was not the problem; what we needed was an analysis of users_Ñé data. This helped us to pinpoint our game_Ñés flaws. Their time spent on each theme encouraged us to improve the less popular themes. Score points showed us whether the game was too easy or challenging. This experience firmly convinced me that a multidirectional education in technology is vital for me to succeed in the 21st century; while searching for the opportunity to explore different aspects of technology, I found the accelerated scholar program Kick Ass Coders. I have an amazing tool called technology, I have yet to learn to utilize its full potential. Selective enrichment experiences of Kick Ass Coders will allow me to enhance my mechanical skills by providing internship, networking, and mentorship opportunities. I especially look forward to participate in education programming focusing on self-reflation of our values, because I will be able to analyze my current situation and discuss how to achieve my goals with experienced mentors. By becoming one of Kick Ass Fellows, I will become a professional who perceives technology_Ñés different aspects.","I particularly have a great interest in learning security system since I desire to create a legal search engine, which will require advanced technological and critical thinking skills to secure data. Thus, I am interested in any opportunity to work as a part of the security team. I will be happy to intern anywhere, but if I could work at Snapchat or Dropbox, I would be really grateful. Dev Akhawe from Dropbox came in to our class as a guest lecturer, and he shared his experience of working as a security specialist at Dropbox, and I was amazed by the works they have accomplished. Similarly, Winston Howes, UNC alumni, from Snapchat also shared his work experiences at Snapchat, and I thought their work is astonishing.","Washington DC, Raleigh-Durham, Silicon Valley","1.
